Agent.io - Real-time, scalable agent<->server messaging for Node.js
========

Agent.io is a simple long polling based Node.js messaging library. It is usefull for use cases, where agents having no inbound access have to talk to servers in both directions in real-time. 

The server part currently relies on Express and Redis. Redis pubsub is used to enable scaling out of servers to serve more agents. Please make sure Redis library is installed `npm install redis`. Redis >= 2.6 is recommended if multiple servers are used.

I might add WebSocket transport at some point if it is proved to be well supported and reliable for server to server use cases. 


## Installation and Usage

Install Agent.io with npm both on client and server

    npm install agent.io 


Agent-side usage

    var agentio = require('agent.io');

    /* if no group name is specified, a unique id will be assigned to the agent */
    var agent = agentio.createClient({group: 'group1', server: 'http://localhost:3000'});

    /* listener for messages, which server sends to "group1" */
    agent.on('message', function(msg) {
    });

    /* sending a message to the server */
    agent.send({field: "value"});



Server-side usage

    /* agent.io */

    var agentio = require('agent.io');

    var server = agentio.createServer();

    /* group1 message listener */
    server.on('group1', function(msg) {
    });

    /* listener for messages from all groups */
    server.on('message', function(group, msg) {
    });

    /* listener for messages from all groups. Returns an array of all 
     * messages sent during one second or single event loop cycle.
     */
    server.on('messages', function(group, msgs) {
    });

    
    /* sending a message to agent */
    server.send('group1', {field: "value"});



    /* express app */

    var express = require('express');
    var app = express.createServer();

    app.configure(function(){
      app.use(express.methodOverride());
      app.use(express.bodyParser());
      app.use(server.middleware()); // agent.io server
    });

    app.get('/', function(req, res){
      res.send('Hello World');
    });

    app.listen(3000);
